## Repository Overview

### Phase 1 – Comparative Analysis of SVM, Decision Trees & Random Forests
A detailed evaluation of classical machine learning models on a benchmark dataset. This phase includes data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and a comparative analysis across multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).

### Phase 2 – Image Classification with CNN
Development and training of a custom Convolutional Neural Network on the MNIST dataset. This phase focuses on model design, training pipelines, and performance evaluation using visualizations like accuracy and loss curves.

## How to Set Up

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MHUZAIFA/COMP-6721-Applied-AI.git
   cd COMP-6721-Applied-AI
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies for each phase:
   ```bash
   pip install -r project/phase1/requirements.txt
   pip install -r project/phase2/requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Phase 1
- Navigate to `project/phase1/Project_Phase1.ipynb` to explore dataset loading, model setups, and evaluation.
- The `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` file outlines each member’s specific tasks in Phase 1.

### Phase 2
- Open `project/phase2/Project_Phase2.ipynb` to run the CNN training and visualize results.
- The detailed analysis is available in `Project_report II (AI_Bots).pdf`.

### Assignments
- `Assignment1_sol (AI_Bots)` and `Assignment2_sol (AI_Bots)` folders contains group work for the respective assignments, they were completed with Jupyter notebooks and report PDFs.

## Results Snapshot

- **Phase 1**: Comparison of SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forests; detailed metrics and performance graphs are included in the notebook and report.
- **Phase 2**: CNN model performance on MNIST with accuracy/loss curves and confusion matrices detailed in both code and report.

---

## Future Work Ideas

- **Phase 1**: Extend to algorithms like XGBoost or include kernels (e.g., SVM with RBF).
- **Phase 2**: Explore deeper CNN architectures, data augmentation techniques, or advanced datasets beyond MNIST.
- Fork, collaborate, and let's explore more together!
